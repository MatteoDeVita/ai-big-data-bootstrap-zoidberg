I must store every test matrices and assign it to it's corresponding label

then I must compute, for a given test matrix, it's k nearest neighbors

then get which label get the more neighbors and assign the matrix to this label

in this case, it wioll not be the euclidian distance or the manhattan distance but the matrix distance

draw graphs of these clusters ?

or we compute the 'mean' of each matrix and compute basic distance





1. Compute the euclidian distance between the matrices
2. get the k nearest ones
